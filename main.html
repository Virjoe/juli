I wish you nothing but the best, always. I wish for your happiness, your dreams to come true, and for every day to bring you joy and laughter. I hope that I can be there to support you, to make you smile, and to share every beautiful moment of life with you.

Still, I kissed you, and you welcomed it with that beautiful smile. That day will forever be etched in my heart, because it’s the day I fell for you even more deeply.')">

I was so thankful that you chose to celebrate my birthday with me, even when I didn’t feel like celebrating at all. The little mini cakes you brought were not just delicious they were a reminder of the thought and care you put into every detail. Every laugh we shared, every small moment we experienced that day, felt like a gift in itself. That day, more than anything, showed me your unconditional love, your patience, and your unwavering support.
